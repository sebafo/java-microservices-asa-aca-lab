# Set up the Application Configuration Service for Azure Spring Apps
    
Once you completed the initial update of your git repository hosting the server configuration, you need to set up the Application Configuration Service for your Azure Spring Apps instance. 

## Step by step guidance

1. Switch to the Git Bash prompt and run the following commands to set the environment variables hosting your GitHub repository and GitHub credentials (replace the `<git-repository>`, `<git-username>`, and `<git-PAT>` placeholders with the URL of your GitHub repository, the name of your GitHub user account, and the newly generated PAT value, respectively).

   {: .note }
   > The URL of the GitHub repository should be in the format `https://github.com/<your-github-username>/spring-petclinic-microservices-config`, where the `<your-github-username>` placeholder represents your GitHub user name.

   ```bash
   GIT_REPO=<git-repository>
   GIT_USERNAME=<git-username>
   GIT_PASSWORD=<git-PAT>
   ```

1. To set up the Configuration Service such that it points to your GitHub repository, from the Git Bash prompt, run the following command.

   ```bash
   az spring config-server git set \
      --name $SPRING_APPS_SERVICE \
      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
      --label main \
      --uri $GIT_REPO \
      --password $GIT_PASSWORD \
      --username $GIT_USERNAME
   ```

   {: .note }
   > In case you are using a branch other than `main` in your config repo, you can change the branch name with the `label` parameter.

   {: .note }
   > Wait for the operation to complete. This might take about 2 minutes.
